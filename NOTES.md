## Ch2 - NumPy
- Working with Arrays in NumPy can be much faster and memory efficient 
- Uses C and Fortran to do optimizations
- Perform functions on a matrix (Vectorization)

## Ch3 - Pandas

- Read entire CSV into memory
- Using a machine in the cloud with a lot of memory to process a large dataset can be more cost effective that trying to run a big data platform - tear it down when finished

## Ch4 
- `df.apply` - Apply a function to every row in the dataFrame
